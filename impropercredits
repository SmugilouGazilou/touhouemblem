Since I can't be assed right now. I'll get to the point.

Since I'm pretty sure I gotta do this or something. Attribution and Credits for work and such.  

First off. I'm only putting this here temporarily until I get all the credits in order.

This is merely here to notify you that as of 4/10/2017 and **the v.0.1.0 Alpha Update** , I have NOT created any of the art in the public release versions of this vidya game at all.

All character icons are from a game called PatchCon! Defend The Library which is made by Twilight Frontier (More Commonly Known As Tasofro) which is the same group that worked on those Touhou Fighting Games if you're interested in checking them out.


All Art-Based Pictures within cutscenes, text-based interactions, menu dialogues, etcetc were randomly given to me by a friend so I'll work on finding those artists in order to credit them as well.

Once more. I have NOT made any of the art and such in this game.

Touhou Project originally belongs to ZUN and as such, I don't own that either. This is just a game based off of his original series.

This is a Fangame and I've, in no way, shape, or form want to, either indirectly or directly somehow receive profit from this. This is just a project for fun and time consumption. 


I'll add onto this as more creditation information is needed/supplied.
