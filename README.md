# Touhou Emblem

------------------------------------------------------------
This here is the project I'm working on to consume time known as Touhou Emblem! Which is essentially another Touhou SRPG-based game! 

Since my only purpose with this is to consume time, I'm relatively open to suggestions and requests and all of that!
------------------------------------------------------------

This here is the home to finding out what the actual fuck is exactly going on with this whole bundle of joy!

Incase you have no idea what's going on. Allow me to explain.  This is just so I can better organize everything.

The "Issues" tab is for posting suggestions/feature requests and bug reports and all of that so I can better look at them and so discussions can better happen.  They'll all be labeled pretty good so you'll know what's about what and such.

Although I doubt they'll happen much if at all.  Discord will automatically post updates of what's happening. That way, people don't have to search all around for a specific issue if they don't want to. But who knows. It's just notification fodder.

"Pull Requests" is for seeing what's being planned to be added in and such. Currently serves little to no purpose but it'll see usage if you guys help it see such.


"Projects" is for knowing what I'm working on and prioritizing. That way, you can get a feel of if you should be asking/bothering me on whether or not your issue is gonna be fixed soon or not.


"Wiki" is going to be an informational page pretty damn soon. Empty now though.


So yeah. This is just the start of some better organization on my eyes.
